*Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Ofﬂoading in Wireless Powered Mobile-Edge Computing Networks*

Python code to reproduce our works on Wireless-powered Mobile-Edge Computing [1], which uses the wireless channel gains as the input and the binary computing mode selection results as the output of a deep neural network (DNN). It includes:

- [memory.py](memory.py): the DNN structure for the WPMEC, inclduing training structure and test structure

- [data](./data): all data are stored in this subdirectory, includes:

  - **data_#.mat**: training and testing data sets, where # = {10, 20, 30} is the user number

- [main.py](main.py): run this file, inclduing setting system parameters
